    "This is all fine, but we run into a problem: there aren't 26 notes in the musical scale. There's luckily a quick fix from this: the modulo operator (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation). In python, that's represented by the **%** symbol. Essentially, the modulo gives you the remainder after performing integer division on a number - 6%3 = 0 because 6/3 is 2 exactly; 6%4 == 2, however, since 6/4 is 1 remainder 2. 100%3 = 1 for the same reason. Another way to look at modulo, though, is as a way to cyclically map an ascending sequence onto a set range of numbers... like our friend the chromatic scale from question 2!\n",

Therefore M would map to 0 would map to the note C. N is likewise 13, which maps to 13%12 = 1, which maps to... C#!\n",
